Fantasy F1 SQL Table Structure:


TABLE DRIVERS

-We insert all of the drivers here
--------------
DriverID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
DriverName - VARCHAR
SALARY - INT (1-6) (Doubt we'd get into decimals for dollars.  Verstappen- $3.99 instead of $4)


TABLE TRACKS

-We insert all of the tracks for the season here
--------------
TrackID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
TrackName - VARCHAR
RaceDate - DateTime
RaceNumber - INT



TABLE RESULTS

-Here's where we post the results
-each entry, you insert: what race it was, the driver, their points for each category
--------------
ResultID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
TrackID - FOREIGN KEY TO Tracks.TrackID
DriverID - FOREIGN KEY TO Drivers.DriverID
QualifyingPoints - INT 
FastLapPoints - INT
PositionChangePoints - INT
ResultPoints - INT



TABLE LEAGUES

-When users create a league, they insert a record here.  I'm sure there's a lot more stuff we could keep track of:
 league created, other stuff I can't think of right now. 
 
When you create league, IsDraft && IsSeason == false
When TotalPlayers == Total of records in Members WHERE IsJoined == true, IsDraft == true
After draft complete, IsDraft == false, IsSeason == true

Active Player is the player that can currently make a move.  
When it's draft time, this is the player who's on the clock.
During season, this could be used to keep track who has claim on FA 
(unless we say screw waiver wire & it's a free for all for who can add/drop -- that's way less programming.)
----------------
LeagueID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
LeagueName - VARCHAR
ModeratorID - FOREIGN KEY TO Users.ID
IsDraft - Bool
IsSeason - Bool
TotalPlayers - INT
ActivePlayer - FOREIGN KEY TO Users.ID
Note - TEXT



TABLE USERS

-Basic table for login validation
----------------
UserID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
UserName - VARCHAR
PASSWORD - VARCHAR
EMAIL - VARCHAR



TABLE MEMBERSHIPS

-Keeps track of what leagues users belong to.  
-------------------------------
MembershipID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
LeagueID - FOREIGN KEY TO Leagues.LeagueID
UserID - FOREIGN KEY TO Users.UserID
IsJoined - Bool



TABLE ROSTERS

-Keeps track of every players' drivers
-------------------------
RosterID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
LeagueID - FOREIGN KEY TO Leagues.LeagueID
UserID - FOREIGN KEY TO Users.UserID
DriverID - FOREIGN KEY TO Drivers.DriverID

TABLE ROSTERS

-Keeps track of every players' drivers
-------------------------
RosterID - INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO-INCREMENT
LeagueID - FOREIGN KEY TO Leagues.LeagueID
UserID - FOREIGN KEY TO Users.UserID
DriverID - FOREIGN KEY TO Drivers.DriverID
RaceNum - FOREIGN KEY TO Tracks.RaceNum

Logic:  Races 1-10: Players cannot duplicate drivers.  Players cannot have more than 2 drivers in one race
